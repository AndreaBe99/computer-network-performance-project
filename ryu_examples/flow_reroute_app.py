# This function should handle all the main logic of the application.
# It is scheduled on a separate thread by BaseSwitch.start() so that the main controller application can run
# independently of the main loop described here.

# Not that, differently from what it was shown in the last lecture, flow rule installation is not handled any more by 
# packet-in messages. This is because flow rule installation should be defined depending on application-controlled
# decisions.
# BaseSwitch will handle packet-in to redirect messages without flow-rules installed, but rtt will be very high.
# The methods for rule installation and deletion are still present and ready to be used for your application.
